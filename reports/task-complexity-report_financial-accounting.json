			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project setup into: 1) Go module initialization with dependencies, 2) Directory structure creation, 3) .gitignore and basic configuration files, 4) Verification and compilation check",
			"reasoning": "Project setup is straightforward but involves multiple discrete steps. Creating go.mod, directory structure, and basic configuration files are well-understood tasks with clear patterns. Low complexity due to minimal business logic."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Domain Model Implementation - Core Types",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement domain types as: 1) Basic enums (AccountType, BookingLogStatus, PostingDirection, PostingResult), 2) Currency type with ISO-4217 validation, 3) Money type with decimal arithmetic, 4) Type validation methods, 5) Unit tests for all types",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to currency validation, decimal arithmetic for Money type, and comprehensive enum handling. Requires careful validation logic and understanding of financial precision requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "FinancialBookingLog Aggregate Root Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement FinancialBookingLog as: 1) Struct definition with all required fields, 2) State transition methods (Suspend, Resume, Close), 3) Validation logic and invariants, 4) Comprehensive unit tests including edge cases",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to aggregate root patterns, state machine implementation, and multiple business invariants. Requires understanding of DDD concepts and careful state transition logic."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "LedgerPosting Entity Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement LedgerPosting entity as: 1) Struct definition with all fields, 2) Core validation methods (amount, currency, date bounds), 3) Idempotency key validation, 4) Currency conversion helpers, 5) Comprehensive unit tests with edge cases",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to multiple validation rules, currency compatibility checks, date validation, and idempotency constraints. Critical for financial accuracy and requires extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Double-Entry Transaction Validation Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement transaction validation as: 1) Transaction struct and basic validation framework, 2) Double-entry balance validation with decimal arithmetic, 3) Multi-currency transaction support with exchange rates, 4) Property-based and edge case testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to core financial accounting principles, decimal precision requirements, multi-currency support, and the need for bulletproof validation. Critical business logic requiring extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Repository Interface and Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement repository layer as: 1) Repository interface definitions, 2) Database schema with proper constraints and indexes, 3) Migration scripts, 4) Schema validation and constraint testing",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to database design considerations, proper indexing strategy, constraint enforcement, and migration management. Requires understanding of PostgreSQL features and performance considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "PostgreSQL Repository Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement PostgreSQL repositories as: 1) FinancialBookingLog repository with CRUD operations, 2) LedgerPosting repository with batch operations, 3) Connection pooling and transaction management, 4) Error handling and mapping, 5) Integration tests with testcontainers, 6) Performance and concurrency testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to database transaction management, batch operations, connection pooling, proper error handling, and the need for integration testing. Requires expertise in PostgreSQL and Go database patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "gRPC Protocol Buffer Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create protobuf definitions as: 1) Service definition with all BIAN operations, 2) Request/response message definitions, 3) Domain events protobuf schema, 4) Validation annotations and compilation verification",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to comprehensive API design, BIAN specification compliance, and protobuf best practices. Requires understanding of gRPC patterns and message design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "gRPC Service Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement gRPC service as: 1) Service struct with dependency injection, 2) InitiateFinancialBookingLog operation, 3) CaptureLedgerPosting with full workflow, 4) Control operations (suspend/resume/close), 5) Retrieve operations, 6) Error handling and status codes, 7) Integration with domain events, 8) Comprehensive testing with mocks and integration tests",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to orchestrating multiple domain objects, implementing full business workflows, idempotency handling, event publishing, and comprehensive error handling. Represents the integration of all previous components."

		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Protocol Buffers Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the protobuf toolchain setup into: 1) Install and configure buf CLI tool with buf.yaml configuration 2) Set up protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc plugins 3) Configure protoc-gen-validate for validation rules 4) Create Makefile targets for proto compilation. Each subtask should focus on a specific tool or configuration file.",
			"reasoning": "This is foundational tooling setup with well-documented installation procedures. The complexity is moderate because it involves multiple tools (buf, protoc-gen-go, protoc-gen-validate) but each has standard installation processes. The project appears to be greenfield with no existing toolchain, making this straightforward configuration work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Common Proto Types and Enums",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Create basic Money and Currency types with validation rules 2) Define AccountType and PostingDirection enums following BIAN standards 3) Create error handling proto with standardized error responses. Focus on BIAN compliance and proper validation rules for each type.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to need to understand BIAN standards and implement proper validation rules. The types themselves are straightforward but ensuring BIAN compliance and proper protoc-gen-validate rules adds complexity. This is foundational work that other tasks depend on."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement FinancialAccounting Proto Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Design FinancialBookingLog message structure with all required fields 2) Create LedgerPosting message with posting logic 3) Define gRPC service methods for booking log operations 4) Create request/response message pairs for all service methods. Each subtask should focus on specific message types or service operations.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the need to understand BIAN FinancialAccounting domain and translate business requirements into proper proto definitions. Requires knowledge of financial accounting concepts and careful design of message structures and service interfaces. This is core business logic implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PositionKeeping Proto Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Design FinancialPositionLog message with transaction logging and audit trail support 2) Create PositionKeeping gRPC service with all required methods 3) Add bulk transaction import capabilities and status tracking mechanisms. Focus on transaction lineage and compliance requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Similar complexity to FinancialAccounting - requires understanding of position keeping and transaction logging concepts from BIAN. The audit trail and compliance requirements add additional complexity. Bulk transaction support increases the design complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CurrentAccount Proto Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Design CurrentAccountFacility message with account identification and status management 2) Create debit/credit transaction operation messages 3) Implement CurrentAccount gRPC service with all account management methods. Focus on account lifecycle and transaction handling.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to account management concepts and transaction handling. Slightly less complex than FinancialAccounting as current account operations are more straightforward, but still requires understanding of banking account concepts and proper transaction modeling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add Comprehensive Validation Rules",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into validation categories: 1) Add required field validation for all request messages 2) Implement string format validation for currencies, UUIDs, and account numbers 3) Add numeric range validation for amounts and limits 4) Create enum validation rules to prevent invalid values 5) Implement custom business rule validation for regulatory compliance. Each subtask focuses on a specific validation type.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity because it requires deep understanding of all proto messages created in tasks 3-5, plus knowledge of regulatory compliance requirements. protoc-gen-validate has its own syntax and patterns that need to be learned. The validation rules need to be comprehensive and cover edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Build Pipeline Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Update Makefile with proto compilation targets 2) Configure buf.gen.yaml for Go code generation to correct directories 3) Set up CI/CD pipeline integration with buf breaking change detection 4) Implement proto version management and dependency handling. Focus on build automation and reproducibility.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving build system integration and CI/CD configuration. Requires understanding of buf tooling, Go module structure, and CI/CD pipelines. The version management aspect adds complexity but follows established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Generate OpenAPI Specifications",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Configure protoc-gen-openapiv2 plugin in buf.gen.yaml 2) Add google.api.http annotations to all proto service methods 3) Generate and validate OpenAPI specs for each service 4) Set up API documentation hosting and validation tools. Focus on proper HTTP method mapping and documentation quality.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately high complexity due to the need to properly map gRPC methods to HTTP endpoints using google.api.http annotations. Requires understanding of OpenAPI specification and proper API design patterns. The validation and hosting setup adds operational complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Proto Documentation and Examples",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: 1) Write comprehensive README.md with proto structure and build instructions 2) Add detailed inline documentation to all proto files with godoc-style comments 3) Create examples directory with sample requests/responses and BIAN compliance mapping. Focus on developer experience and compliance documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on documentation quality and completeness. Requires understanding of all implemented protos and BIAN standards to write accurate documentation. The examples need to be correct and useful for developers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Proto Testing and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize testing into: 1) Set up buf lint configuration with strict style rules 2) Create Go code compilation and import tests 3) Implement protoc-gen-validate integration tests 4) Add CI pipeline integration for breaking change detection 5) Create performance tests for proto serialization. Focus on comprehensive quality assurance and automation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to create comprehensive testing framework covering multiple aspects: linting, compilation, validation, breaking changes, and performance. Requires understanding of testing best practices and integration with CI/CD pipelines. The performance testing adds additional complexity."

			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Initialize go.mod with proper module name and Go version, 2) Create directory structure following Go project layout (internal/, api/, cmd/, pkg/), 3) Add and verify core dependencies (gRPC, protobuf, UUID, decimal, PostgreSQL driver) with initial .gitignore",
			"reasoning": "Fresh project setup with standard Go conventions. Low complexity as it involves file creation and dependency management without complex logic. Based on directory structure showing no existing Go files."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement CurrentAccountFacility struct with all fields and validation, 2) Create AccountTransaction entity with proper relationships, 3) Implement Money value object with decimal precision and currency handling, 4) Add domain enums (AccountStatus, TransactionType) with validation, 5) Implement all business methods (Debit, Credit, CanDebit, Freeze, etc.) with invariant enforcement",
			"reasoning": "Complex domain modeling with financial precision requirements, business invariants, and multiple entity relationships. High complexity due to money handling, state transitions, and overdraft logic requiring careful implementation."

			"reasoning": "Database design for financial data requires careful consideration of decimal precision, constraints, and performance. Medium-high complexity due to financial data modeling and constraint enforcement."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement FinancialAccounting Proto Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down FinancialAccounting proto implementation into: 1) Define FinancialBookingLog message with BIAN-compliant fields, 2) Define LedgerPosting message with posting operations, 3) Create FinancialAccountingService gRPC interface, 4) Design request/response message pairs for all methods, 5) Add comprehensive validation rules using protoc-gen-validate",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to BIAN specification compliance requirements, multiple interconnected message types, comprehensive gRPC service interface design, and validation rules. Existing common types reduce some complexity but financial accounting domain requires careful design for regulatory compliance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PositionKeeping Proto Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down PositionKeeping proto implementation into: 1) Extend existing FinancialPositionLog with bulk transaction support, 2) Add status tracking enhancements for compliance, 3) Implement transaction lineage and audit trail improvements, 4) Create comprehensive list and filtering operations",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Task is already in-progress with substantial work completed. The existing position_keeping.proto shows comprehensive implementation with proper validation, audit trails, and bulk operations. Remaining work focuses on refinements and additional features rather than greenfield development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CurrentAccount Proto Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down CurrentAccount proto implementation into: 1) Define CurrentAccountFacility message with account identification and status management, 2) Implement account balance tracking and overdraft limits, 3) Create debit/credit transaction operations, 4) Add transaction history and account status management features",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to account management operations, balance tracking, overdraft handling, and transaction history. Benefits from existing common types and established patterns from PositionKeeping implementation. Requires careful design for account state management and transaction operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add Comprehensive Validation Rules",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down validation rules implementation into: 1) Add required field and format validation for all proto messages, 2) Implement business-specific validation rules (currency codes, account numbers, amounts), 3) Add comprehensive enum and pattern validation for regulatory compliance",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Codebase already uses protoc-gen-validate extensively with proper patterns established. Task involves applying consistent validation patterns across multiple proto files. The existing types.proto shows comprehensive validation examples to follow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Build Pipeline Integration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down build pipeline integration into: 1) Enhance existing Makefile proto targets with version management, 2) Configure CI/CD pipeline integration with buf breaking change detection, 3) Set up reproducible builds and dependency management for protoc plugins",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity. The Makefile already has comprehensive proto targets with buf integration. The buf.gen.yaml is properly configured for Go code generation. Task mainly involves extending existing working pipeline rather than creating from scratch."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Generate OpenAPI Specifications",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down OpenAPI generation into: 1) Add protoc-gen-openapiv2 plugin to buf.gen.yaml and configure HTTP annotations, 2) Generate swagger.json files for each service with proper documentation, 3) Set up OpenAPI validation and documentation hosting",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Requires adding new protoc plugin, configuring HTTP annotations in proto files, and setting up OpenAPI generation pipeline. Benefits from existing buf configuration but needs significant additions for HTTP/REST API generation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Proto Documentation and Examples",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down proto documentation into: 1) Create comprehensive README explaining proto structure and build process, 2) Add inline godoc-style comments to all proto files, 3) Create examples directory with sample requests/responses and BIAN compliance mapping",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity. Primarily documentation work that follows established patterns. Existing proto files show good commenting practices. Task involves systematic documentation rather than complex technical implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Proto Testing and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down proto testing framework into: 1) Set up buf lint with strict rules and style consistency, 2) Create integration tests for generated Go code compilation, 3) Implement protoc-gen-validate testing with invalid inputs, 4) Add performance tests for proto serialization and CI pipeline integration",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Requires comprehensive testing framework setup, integration with existing Go test infrastructure, performance testing, and CI integration. Benefits from established Makefile and testing patterns but needs significant test infrastructure development."

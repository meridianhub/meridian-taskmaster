		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Go Module Initialization",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into specific setup tasks: 1) Go module and basic directory structure, 2) Makefile and build configuration, 3) CI/CD pipeline files (.github/workflows), 4) Documentation and project configuration files",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily configuration and scaffolding work. Low complexity as it's mostly file creation and standard Go project setup patterns. Since the codebase is empty (no existing Go files found), this is greenfield setup with well-established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Layer Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into manageable components: 1) Core DB interface and connection pool setup, 2) Context-aware query execution with timeouts, 3) Transaction management helpers, 4) Health checks and retry logic, 5) Integration tests with testcontainers",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to distributed database considerations (CockroachDB/YugabyteDB), connection pooling nuances, graceful shutdown handling, and comprehensive testing requirements. Critical foundation component requiring careful design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Migration System Setup",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize by functionality: 1) golang-migrate integration and CLI setup, 2) Migration runner implementation with proper error handling, 3) Initial schema migration creation, 4) CI/CD integration and testing framework",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving third-party tool integration, database schema management, and CI/CD automation. Requires careful handling of migration state and rollback scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Event Streaming (Kafka) Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into producer/consumer components: 1) Kafka producer with idempotency configuration, 2) Consumer framework with group management, 3) Dead letter queue implementation, 4) Serialization layer (JSON/Protobuf), 5) Error handling and retry logic, 6) Integration testing with testcontainers",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to distributed systems challenges, at-least-once delivery guarantees, consumer group management, and sophisticated error handling. Kafka integration has many edge cases and configuration nuances."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "OpenTelemetry Tracing Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure by component: 1) Tracer initialization and OTLP exporter setup, 2) gRPC interceptors for automatic span creation, 3) Context propagation and sampling configuration, 4) Helper functions and testing framework",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with well-established patterns. OpenTelemetry has good Go SDK support, but requires careful context propagation and configuration for distributed tracing across services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Prometheus Metrics and Structured Logging",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize by observability domain: 1) Prometheus metrics collection and endpoint setup, 2) Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs, 3) PII redaction utilities and integration testing",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with standard observability patterns. Prometheus has mature Go client libraries, and structured logging is well-established. Main challenges are PII redaction and proper correlation ID propagation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "JWT Authentication and OAuth Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split by authentication mechanism: 1) JWT validation with RS256 and key rotation, 2) Claims extraction and gRPC interceptor, 3) OAuth 2.0 provider integration (Auth0/Okta), 4) Token introspection endpoint, 5) Service account client credentials flow",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to security requirements, multiple authentication flows, public key rotation handling, and integration with external OAuth providers. Security-critical component requiring extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "RBAC Authorization Framework",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize by authorization layer: 1) Role definitions and data structures, 2) Permission checking middleware and validation, 3) JWT claims integration and role extraction, 4) Resource-specific authorization helpers and testing",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity building on JWT authentication. RBAC patterns are well-established, but requires careful design for extensibility and proper integration with existing authentication layer."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Redis-based Idempotency Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure by functionality: 1) Redis storage interface and key management, 2) Distributed locking with SETNX operations, 3) TTL-based expiration and cleanup logic, 4) Integration testing with Redis testcontainer",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to distributed locking semantics, race condition handling, and proper TTL management. Redis operations require careful consideration of atomic operations and failure scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Health Check System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize by health check type: 1) Basic liveness and readiness probes, 2) Dependency status monitoring (DB, Kafka, Redis), 3) Kubernetes compatibility and response formatting",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with standard patterns for health checks. Depends on multiple other components but follows well-established Kubernetes probe patterns. Main complexity is in dependency timeout handling and status aggregation."

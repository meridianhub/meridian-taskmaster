			"taskTitle": "Initialize Go project structure and dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Initialize go.mod and basic directory structure, 2) Add core dependencies and configure Makefile, 3) Create .env.example and verify project setup",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward project initialization task. Creating directories and adding dependencies is well-documented with clear success criteria. Low technical complexity."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define gRPC protobuf contracts for Position Keeping service",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create position_keeping.proto service definition with all operations, 2) Define message types and enums for domain model, 3) Create events.proto and configure buf.yaml with validation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to BIAN specification requirements and protobuf intricacies. Requires understanding of business domain and proper message design. Well-defined scope helps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement core domain model with FinancialPositionLog aggregate",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement FinancialPositionLog struct and Money value object, 2) Create enums and status transition state machine, 3) Implement business methods with invariant validation, 4) Add comprehensive unit tests for domain logic",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to business rules, state machine logic, and invariant enforcement. Core domain model requires careful design and extensive testing. Business logic complexity is significant."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create database schema and migration scripts",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Design financial_position_logs table schema with constraints, 2) Create audit trail table and indexes, 3) Implement migration tooling and scripts, 4) Test migrations and constraint enforcement",
			"reasoning": "Database design requires careful consideration of performance, constraints, and audit requirements. Migration tooling adds complexity. Proper indexing strategy is critical for performance."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement repository layer with PostgreSQL persistence",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Define repository interface and error types, 2) Implement basic CRUD operations with connection pooling, 3) Implement efficient bulk operations and transaction support, 4) Add filtering and pagination for List operations, 5) Create comprehensive integration tests with testcontainers",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to database integration challenges, bulk operations optimization, and concurrent access patterns. Requires testcontainers setup and comprehensive testing."

			"taskTitle": "Implement domain events and event publishing infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create domain event structs and interfaces, 2) Implement EventPublisher interface and in-memory implementation, 3) Add message broker implementation with serialization, 4) Implement event sourcing and middleware with correlation IDs",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving event-driven architecture patterns. Event versioning and serialization add complexity. Message broker integration requires careful error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement idempotency checking and duplicate prevention",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Define IdempotencyChecker interface and basic implementation, 2) Implement Redis-based distributed idempotency with TTL, 3) Add database fallback and race condition handling, 4) Create gRPC middleware for automatic idempotency, 5) Implement batch idempotency and comprehensive concurrent testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to distributed systems challenges, race conditions, and concurrent request handling. Redis integration and fallback mechanisms add significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement gRPC service layer with all BIAN operations",
